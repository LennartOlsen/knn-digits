### Using KNN for prediction of handwritten ciphers in R.
Created for the course statistical machine learning at University of southern denmark.

Excersise 1:
Findings were that i am rubbish at handwriting and even worse at predicting it. With a K of 5 i hit a accuracy of ~31%.

Excersise 2:
Higher K produces lower accuracies and takes more time. see images accuracy.png and time.png
